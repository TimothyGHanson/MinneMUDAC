# MinneMUDAC
Notebook containing my final MinneMUDAC report for the company Big Brothers Big Sisters Twin Cities
This project was developed for the MinneMUDAC 2025 Data Science Challenge in collaboration with Big Brothers Big Sisters Twin Cities. Our team built predictive models to identify key drivers of successful, long-lasting mentor-mentee matches.

We used historical program data to:

Analyze match durations and success rates

Build models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost

Uncover insights from support notes using text analytics (TF-IDF, WordCloud)

Key findings revealed that mentor age, program timing, note frequency, and family involvement significantly impact match longevity. This work helps BBBS make data-driven decisions to support 2,200 youth with stronger, longer-lasting mentorships.
